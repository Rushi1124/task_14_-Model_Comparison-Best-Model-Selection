# Breast Cancer Classification & Model Comparison

## Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow on the Breast Cancer dataset from Kaggle. It includes:  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Training multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Comparison of model performance via table and bar plot  
- Selection and saving of the best model for deployment  

## Tools
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Joblib  

## Steps
1. Load and preprocess dataset  
2. Split into train and test sets  
3. Train multiple models on same data  
4. Evaluate models and create comparison table  
5. Visualize performance with bar plot  
6. Save best-performing model  

## Deliverables
- Model comparison table  
- Performance bar chart  
- Saved best model (`best_model_breast_cancer.pkl`)
